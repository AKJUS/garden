name: Post-release automation

# Triggered by CircleCI's github-release-tag job via workflow_dispatch after creating a draft release.
# (GitHub does not fire release events for draft releases, so we use workflow_dispatch instead.)
#
# Can also be triggered manually from the Actions UI to re-run or test the pipeline.
#
# This workflow:
# 1. Checks if this is an automated release (commit authored by github-actions[bot])
# 2. Runs a smoke test on the release binary
# 3. Generates release notes from the changelog
# 4. Publishes the draft release
#
# Manual releases (where a human ran release.ts directly) are detected and skipped,
# allowing the maintainer to edit the draft and publish it manually.
#
# Publishing then triggers publish-release.yml (Homebrew) and auto-merge-release-pr.yml.
